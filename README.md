# static-nuns

A simple static site generator based on nunjucks, LESS and markdown.

There is a sample site provided in the "test" folder:

```
cd test
node ../app.js
```

This creates a `_site` folder and populates it with `.html` files mirroring each `.md` file, with the same directory structure.

By default each markdown file is fed to the nunjucks template at `layouts/default.html`. The HTML generated by markdown is passed as the `content` variable. The title, which you set by using a top-level heading in markdown (start that line with a single `#`), is passed as the `title` variable.

To make relative links between pages just use the standard Markdown syntax. Keep in mind each file will have a `.html` extension.

To make absolute links, always preface your URL with `{{ root }}`. This ensures that you can copy your `_site` folder into github pages or another environment where it will be in a subdirectory and not at the actual root of the site.

### Stylesheets

If there is a file called `stylesheets/main.less`, it is compiled with LESS, and the result is stored at `_sites/stylesheets/main.css`. Yes, you may `@import` more `.less` files from that folder.

### Static Assets

The folders `fonts` and `images` are copied verbatim into folders of the same name in the `_site` folder.

### Building Your Own Site

Use:

```
npm install -g static-nuns
```

Now you can just `cd` to a folder containing the appropriate content and type:

```
static-nuns
```

To rebuild.

## TODO

Pick a real name. Maybe.
