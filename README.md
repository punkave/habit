# habit

A simple static site generator based on nunjucks, LESS and markdown.

There is a sample site provided in the "test" folder:

```bash
cd test
node ../app.js
```

This creates a `_site` folder and copies and converts your files like this:

* `.md` files are compiled with markdown and converted to `.html` as described below.
* `main.less` files are compiled with LESS and converted to `.css` as described below.
* Files and folders starting with `.` or `_` are ignored.
* Everything else is simply copied.

### Layout files for markdown

By default each markdown file is fed to the nunjucks template at `_layouts/default.html`. The HTML generated by markdown is passed as the `content` variable. The title, which you set by using a top-level heading in markdown (start that line with a single `#`), is passed as the `title` variable.

### Using other layouts

Insert an HTML comment with an extra `-` to specify the layout:

```html
<!--- layout: alternate -->
```

This will use the nunjucks template `_layouts/alternate.html` instead.

Yes, you may use the nunjucks `extends` keyword to extend another layout, override blocks and all that cool stuff.

### Relative links in Markdown

To make relative links between pages just use the standard Markdown syntax. Keep in mind each file will have a `.html` extension.

### Absolute links within the site in Markdown

To make absolute links with in your site, always preface your URL with `{{ root }}`. This ensures that you can copy your `_site` folder into github pages or another environment where it will be in a subdirectory and not at the actual root of the site. If you know your content will be at the root you may ignore this.

### LESS stylesheets

If there is a file called `main.less`, it is compiled with LESS, and the result is stored as `main.css`. Yes, you may `@import` more `.less` files from your `main.less` file. You may have multiple `main.less` files in separate folders, if you are really on fire to have separate LESS compilation for them for some reason.

You may also use plain old `.css` files, which are simply copied.

### Static assets

Need static assets like fonts and images? No problem; they are automatically copied, because they are not `.less` or `.md` files.

### Building your own sites

Install `habit` globally:

```bash
npm install -g habit
```

Now you can just `cd` to a folder containing the appropriate content and type:

```bash
habit
```

To rebuild.

## Changelog

0.1.6: fixed `@import` in LESS.

0.1.3, 0.1.4, 0.1.5: renamed `habit`.

0.1.2: global install works.

0.1.1: introduced the policy of ignoring dotfiles and `_` files, filtering markdown and LESS, and just copying everything else. This makes much more sense than a long list of special cases. This change renames the `layouts` folder to `_layouts` so they won't be copied.
